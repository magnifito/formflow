# FormFlow Docs Index (context/)

## Essential (keep fresh)
- `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md` — how env vars are loaded for dev/prod/Docker.
- `DOCKER.md` — what each compose file runs.
- `PORTS.md` — service port map.
- `NX_SETUP.md` — Nx workflow basics.
- `TESTING.md` — strategy, quick smoke test, Lab steps, seed summary; pair with `CODE_COVERAGE.md`.
- `SECURITY.md` — security surfaces and controls.
- `SUPER_ADMIN_SETUP.md` — how to bootstrap access.

## Useful, keep but slim when you touch them
- `integrations-stacking.md` — inheritance model; keep aligned with resolver/graph behavior.
- `submission-processing.md` — queue/pg-boss design; update if worker changes.
- `PACKAGE_UPGRADES.md` — only keep current breaking notes; prune old versions.

## Non-markdown extras
- `CNAME` — required for hosting; leave as is.
